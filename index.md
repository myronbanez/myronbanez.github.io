[Predicting NJ Transit Delays](/Final.html)

In 2019, and for the second year in a row, NJT Trains broke down more than any other system in the county (according to the Federal Transit Administration). In January 2021, NJT ordered 25 new dual-powered locomotives that are in the process of being distributed and in 2023, 113 new multi-level rail cars will arrive to replace the 40-year old previous fleet. The mechanical failure rate of the new cars is a fraction of the previous fleetâ€™s. In collaboration with Amelia Marcantonio-Fields, our model-based dashboard sets out to create a capital improvement plan to help NJT track where delays are the longest and prioritize lines that are experiencing frequent delays with the most profit potential by predicting delays into the future for CIP planning. Currently, the model focuses on the 5 lines that go directly into NYC.

[Equitable Recidivism Algorithm Memo](/Recidivism.pdf)

Recidivism algorithms are often developed with disparate impact that disproportionately affects African-Americans in an inequitable system. Utilizing data from Nortpointe, I created a fictional memo to the mayor of Vallejo, CA on a proposed new recidivsm algorithm and job re-entry program with the associate costs and benefits.

[Predictive Policing in Chicago](/Policing.html)

Policing often targets communities of color and residents low-income neighborhoods as the perpetrators of crime, perpetuating greater racial and class discrimination in society. This leads to over policing in neighborhoods and does more harm than help, and instances such as injust police brutality occur as a result.

This analysis hopes to build a model that explores the relationship between crime risk in Chicago and exposure to various risk factors that could make an individual a victim of a crime. Although robberies can happen to anyone, this model in particular looks at more of the spatial risk factors or the environments in which someone is in that would make their risk of being robbed even higher.
