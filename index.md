### Geospatial Analysis using RStudio

[Predicting NJ Transit Delays](/Final.html)

In 2019, and for the second year in a row, NJT Trains broke down more than any other system in the county (according to the Federal Transit Administration). In January 2021, NJT ordered 25 new dual-powered locomotives that are in the process of being distributed and in 2023, 113 new multi-level rail cars will arrive to replace the 40-year old previous fleet. The mechanical failure rate of the new cars is a fraction of the previous fleet’s. In collaboration with Amelia Marcantonio-Fields, our model-based dashboard sets out to create a capital improvement plan to help NJT track where delays are the longest and prioritize lines that are experiencing frequent delays with the most profit potential by predicting delays into the future for CIP planning. Currently, the model focuses on the 5 lines that go directly into NYC.

[Equitable Recidivism Algorithm Memo](/Recidivism.pdf)

Recidivism algorithms are often developed with disparate impact that disproportionately affects African-Americans in an inequitable system. Utilizing data from Nortpointe, I created a fictional memo to the mayor of Vallejo, CA on a proposed new recidivsm algorithm and job re-entry program with the associate costs and benefits.

[Transit Oriented Development Around Seattle’s Streetcar](/TOD.html)

Seattle’s Streetcar system is loved by many residents and visitors for the quick and reliable service between neighborhoods. Owned by the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) and operated by King County Metro, the Streetcar is a modern mode of transportation with time intervals between 10-15 minutes. The system currently has two lines: South Lake Union and First Hill. South Lake Union runs through the South Lake Union and Belltown neighborhoods, while the First Hill line runs through the First Hill, Capitol Hill, Central District, Chinatown-International District, and Pioneer Square neighborhoods. Transit oriented development (TOD) is an urban development and transportation strategy that aims to cluster businesses, housing, social services, and people around transit points to increase accessibility and promote sustainability. With a system already utilized by many, how can the Streetcar facilitate in improving TOD in the neighborhoods and people it services?

[Predictive Policing in Chicago](/Policing.html)

Policing often targets communities of color and residents low-income neighborhoods as the perpetrators of crime, perpetuating greater racial and class discrimination in society. This leads to over policing in neighborhoods and does more harm than help, and instances such as injust police brutality occur as a result.

This analysis hopes to build a model that explores the relationship between crime risk in Chicago and exposure to various risk factors that could make an individual a victim of a crime. Although robberies can happen to anyone, this model in particular looks at more of the spatial risk factors or the environments in which someone is in that would make their risk of being robbed even higher.

[Housing and Community Development Tax Credit Program Evaluation](/Housing.html)

The Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in Emil City has an established tax credit home repair program that has been in place for close to 20 years. HCD tries to proactively reach out to eligible homeowners ever year, the uptake of the credit is woefully inadequate. Typically only 11% of eligible homeowners they reach out to take the credit. The cost of marketing material allocation is $2,850 and credit costs are $5,000. Academic researchers in Philadelphia evaluated the program finding that houses that transacted after taking the credit, sold with a $10,000 premium, on average. Homes surrounding the repaired home see an aggregate premium of $56,000, on average. As a result this cost-benefit analysis aims to direct Emil City’s Department of Housing and Community Development to a more targeted and intentional program.
